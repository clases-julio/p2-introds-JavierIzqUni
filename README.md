## Observations

This was my first time creating a class diagram, so I wasn't sure how to do it.

What I tried to do was to create a rough sketch of the classes needed, but in order to make the classes that have a hardware part, like the cameras, sensors or microphones, for example, I needed more information about it (how do they capture the data, if they have API, ...).

Also another problem was how to use the uml features, like the arrows, so I added a bit of extra text in each line to make it easier to understand, in case that I didn't use the corresponding arrow.

I think that the class diagram is almost complete, except the details that I explained earlier.
